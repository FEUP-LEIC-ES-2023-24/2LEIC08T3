Welcome to the documentation pages of the GreenScan!

You can find here details about the GreenScan, from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions, a kind of Software Development Report, organized by type of activities: 

* [Business Modelling](docs/BusinessModelling.md)
  * [Product Vision](docs/BusinessModelling.md#Product-Vision)
  * [Features and Assumptions](docs/BusinessModelling.md#Features-and-Assumptions)
  * [Elevator Pitch](docs/BusinessModelling.md#Elevator-Pitch)
* [Requirements](docs/Requirements.md)
  * [Domain model](docs/Requirements.md#Domain-Model)
  * [Mockup](docs/Requirements.md###Mockup)
* [Architecture and Design](docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md###Logical-architecture)
  * [Logical architecture](docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md)
  * [Physical architecture](docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md#Physical-architecture)
  * [Vertical prototype](docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md###Vertical-prototype)
* [Project management]

Contributions are expected to be made exclusively by the initial team, but we may open them to the community, after the course, in all areas and topics: requirements, technologies, development, experimentation, testing, etc.

Please contact us!

### Elevator Pitch

In modern times, with a wide range of brands and products, it's tough to know if the products you buy are actually good for your health and for the health of the planet. Our app, GreenScan, changes that hard choices. With a simple barcode, you get instant acess to sustainability ratings, manufacturing details, and full information of a product's environmental impact. Plus, you can find stores near you that carry the sustainable items you want. We put the power of conscious shopping right in your pocket, helping you make informed choices that align with your values.
